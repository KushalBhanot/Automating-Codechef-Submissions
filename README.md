# Automating Codechef Submissions
I was always fascinated by what developers did on the internet.
And automation is one of these things.
So, I decided to automate Codechef Submissions, but still didn't feel very proud of it.

I'm looking for a more fun project in this field, so if you have something in your mind...contact me ->

## Selenium
Selenium automates browsers. That's it!
What you do with that power is entirely up to you.
Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that.

Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well.

## Cloning
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/KushalBhanot/Automating-Codechef-Submissions.git
```
